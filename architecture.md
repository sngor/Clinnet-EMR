# Clinnet-EMR Serverless Architecture

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](https://d1.awsstatic.com/architecture-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagrams/serverless-web-app-architecture-diagram.2f43b04b7e9b40b4ebd88f3f74b5b802c1d3e2df.png)

## Components

### Frontend
- **AWS Amplify Hosting**: Hosts the React application with CI/CD pipeline
- **Amazon Cognito**: User authentication and authorization
- **AWS AppSync**: GraphQL API for real-time data synchronization (optional)

### Backend
- **Amazon API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoints
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for business logic
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for patient records, appointments, etc.
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for medical documents, images, etc.
- **AWS Parameter Store**: Secure storage for application configuration

### Security & Compliance
- **AWS WAF**: Web Application Firewall for security
- **AWS KMS**: Key Management Service for encryption
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
- **AWS X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for performance analysis

## Data Flow

1. Users authenticate through Cognito
2. Frontend makes API calls to API Gateway
3. API Gateway routes requests to appropriate Lambda functions
4. Lambda functions process business logic and interact with DynamoDB
5. S3 stores and retrieves medical documents and images
6. CloudWatch monitors the entire system

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with user demand
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Security**: Built-in security features for healthcare data
- **Compliance**: HIPAA-eligible services
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns with microservices
- **Development Speed**: Rapid development and deployment
