# Amplify Optional Integration

This folder contains all files and configuration needed to use AWS Amplify for the Clinnet-EMR frontend. If you wish to use S3 + CloudFront instead, you can ignore this folder.

- Move all Amplify-related files and configuration here.
- The default frontend will use S3 + CloudFront for deployment and API access.

# This folder contains all Amplify-related files as an optional alternative to S3/CloudFront deployment.

# If you want to use Amplify, move these files back to the main project as needed.
