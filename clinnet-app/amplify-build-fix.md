# Amplify Deployment Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the AWS Amplify deployment issue.

## Issue

The deployment was failing with the following error:

```
Could not resolve "./App" from "src/main.jsx"
```

This occurred because the `App.jsx` file was located in the `src/app` directory, but the import in `main.jsx` was looking for it directly in the `src` directory.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Created a redirect file**: Added a new `src/App.jsx` file that simply re-exports the App component from its actual location:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx - Redirect file
import App from './app/App';
export default App;
```

2. **Updated environment variable handling**: Enhanced the application to properly handle both VITE_ and REACT_APP_ prefixed environment variables.

3. **Added environment variable validation**: Created a script to check for required environment variables before building.

4. **Ensured proper Vite configuration**: Updated the Vite config to use 'build' as the output directory to match Amplify's expectations.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push these changes to your repository.

2. In the AWS Amplify Console, ensure the following environment variables are set:
   - API_ENDPOINT
   - COGNITO_REGION
   - USER_POOL_ID
   - USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
   - S3_BUCKET
   - S3_REGION

3. Trigger a new build in the Amplify Console.

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:

1. The application loads correctly
2. Authentication works properly
3. API calls are successful
4. S3 storage operations work as expected

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Amplify build logs for any errors
2. Verify that all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure the build output directory is set to 'build' in both Vite config and Amplify settings
