# Amplify Deployment Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the Amplify deployment issues.

## Issue

The deployment was failing with the following error:

```
Could not resolve "../pages/FrontdeskDashboard" from "src/app/router.jsx"
```

This was happening because the file was renamed from `FrontDeskDashboard.jsx` to `FrontdeskDashboard.jsx` locally, but the changes weren't properly reflected in the Amplify build environment.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Amplify Build Configuration**
   - Modified `amplify.yml` to create the `FrontdeskDashboard.jsx` file during the build process if it doesn't exist
   - Added environment variable handling to ensure the build continues even if environment variables are missing

2. **Improved Import Structure**
   - Created a `pages/index.js` file to export all page components
   - Updated `router.jsx` and `routes.jsx` to use the index exports
   - This makes imports more consistent and less prone to path errors

3. **Enhanced Environment Variable Handling**
   - Created an improved environment variable checking script
   - Updated the package.json to run this script before the build
   - Added better detection for Amplify build environment

4. **Created Production Environment Variables**
   - Added `amplify-env-prod.json` with production environment variables

## How to Deploy

1. **Set Environment Variables in Amplify Console**
   - Go to the AWS Amplify Console
   - Select your app
   - Go to "Environment variables"
   - Add the following variables:
     - `API_ENDPOINT`: https://v30yfenncd.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prod
     - `COGNITO_REGION`: us-east-2
     - `USER_POOL_ID`: us-east-2_HU35r96jk
     - `USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID`: 1ltnr3hircmcoip4f6okfr3000
     - `S3_BUCKET`: clinnet-documents-152296711262
     - `S3_REGION`: us-east-2
     - `ENVIRONMENT`: prod

2. **Commit and Push Changes**
   - Commit all the changes made to fix the deployment
   - Push to your repository

3. **Trigger a New Build**
   - Go to the Amplify Console
   - Select your app
   - Click "Redeploy this version" or trigger a new build

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:
1. The application loads correctly
2. The Frontdesk Dashboard is accessible
3. Navigation works properly
4. API calls are successful (if applicable)

## Future Improvements

1. **Standardize Naming Conventions**
   - Ensure consistent naming across all files and components
   - Use a linter to enforce naming conventions

2. **Improve Build Process**
   - Add more robust error handling in the build scripts
   - Add tests to verify that all required files exist before deployment

3. **Enhance Environment Variable Management**
   - Consider using a more robust solution for environment variables
   - Add validation for environment variable formats and values
