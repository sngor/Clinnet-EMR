# Amplify Deployment Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the Amplify deployment issues.

## Issue 1: Package Version Mismatch

The deployment was failing with the following error:

```
npm error Invalid: lock file's @mui/x-data-grid@8.2.0 does not satisfy @mui/x-data-grid@6.20.4
```

This indicated a mismatch between the package.json and package-lock.json files.

### Solution

Updated the package.json file to match the version in the package-lock.json:

```json
"@mui/x-data-grid": "^8.2.0"
```

## Issue 2: Build Process Configuration

The default Amplify build process was using `npm ci`, which requires package.json and package-lock.json to be in sync.

### Solution

Updated the amplify.yml file to use `npm install` instead of `npm ci`:

```yaml
preBuild:
  commands:
    - echo "Checking for package.json and package-lock.json sync issues"
    - npm install
    # Other commands...
```

This allows npm to update the package-lock.json file if needed during the build process.

## Issue 3: S3 Bucket Naming Conflict

The backend deployment was failing because the S3 bucket name was already in use.

### Solution

Updated the S3 bucket name in template.yaml to include environment, account ID, and region:

```yaml
BucketName: !Sub clinnet-documents-${Environment}-${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}
```

This ensures a unique bucket name for each deployment.

## How to Deploy

1. **Push the changes to your repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger a new build in Amplify Console**:
   - Go to the AWS Amplify Console
   - Select your app
   - Click "Redeploy this version"

3. **Deploy the backend**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh prod
   ```

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:
1. The frontend application loads correctly
2. The backend API is accessible
3. The FrontdeskDashboard component renders properly
4. All environment variables are correctly set

## Future Recommendations

1. **Keep Dependencies in Sync**: Regularly update your dependencies and ensure package.json and package-lock.json are in sync.

2. **Use Consistent Naming Conventions**: Follow consistent naming conventions for components and files.

3. **Implement CI/CD Checks**: Add pre-commit hooks or CI/CD checks to catch these issues before deployment.

4. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Use environment-specific configurations for different deployment environments.
